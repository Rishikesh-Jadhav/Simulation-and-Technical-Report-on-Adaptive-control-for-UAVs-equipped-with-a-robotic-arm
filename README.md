# Simulation-and-Technical-Report using Latex-on-Adaptive-control-for-UAVs-equipped-with-a-robotic-arm
- Wrote a Technical Report as well as performed simulations on Adaptive control for UAVs equipped with a robotic arm
- Solved problem of motion control of end effector attached on a quadrotor by a hierarchical control architecture.
- Wrote a technical report and performed simulation on the research paper study using modeling, kinematic 
  control scheme and stability analysis.
